						<h1> Group and Project Choice </h1>
						<p>
							Team formation day has come and gone and it was extremely chaotic and a little bit stressful. Fortunately I got to join my first preference group and meet my team members. It was kind of odd starting to discuss a project we would be working on for an entire year with complete strangers but I guess that’s how it would be in the real world at a real job.

							Team formation day was really strange because it turns out that two of the groups I was interested had merged together, leaving two masters students looking for two-three other students to complete their group. Heaps of people were interested in their group which made it a difficult process to get into. I kind of had to push and bother them about giving me an answer to whether I was in or not because I wanted to make sure I got my second preference if that one fell through. Luckily they decided that my past experiences were enough to let me in. We ended up with only four people, two masters students, and two third year students. The other third year actually seems like the most experienced and talented in the group and he seemed to have a lot of experience with the technology we would be working with.

							It turns out his idea for an RPG game specifically wasn’t exactly set in stone and was quite open to suggestions. We discussed what made mobile apps successful and common traits of the top mobile apps and kind of decided that maybe an RPG game would have too much going on for a small screen such as a phone. It kind of turned into a democratic process and we decided that at our next meeting, we would all put forth our own game ideas and we would vote on the best idea. While not being something that would generally happen outside of a startup, it was fantastic that I could be included in design choices. I can’t really say much as to if this is the best way to begin, but I feel as though it’s the best thing we could do as far as forming our team and project is concerned, and I hope it works.
