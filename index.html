						<h1> Introduction and Overview </h1>
						<p>
						I didn’t really know what to expect from this course. All I had heard from friends who had taken the course before was that it was a yearlong group project. It was kind of daunting thinking that I would be stuck with the same people for an entire year and it really made me fret about the importance of getting a good group of people that I could trust and rely on. 
						</p>
						<p>
						After hearing about TechLauncher, I was confident that I could find such a team. Surely someone would put across an idea I could get behind. I was considering putting forward my own idea, which would have been a mobile video game. I decided against it because I wanted to work as part of a team where I had little say what was going on to prepare myself for working graduate jobs. I did this because I want to experience being told what to do, when to do it and if it was good work or not. If I’m the project leader then I don’t think I would get the full experience I was after.
						</p>
						<p>
						Overall the course sounds like a lot of fun so far and I am excited and nervous for the team orientation day and picking my project.
