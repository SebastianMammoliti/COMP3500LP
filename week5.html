						<h1> Roadblocks in Design</h1>
						<p> This has been the most disheartening week so far, as we’ve basically come to a standstill at the design phase of our project. Figuring out what is going to be fun and what isn’t going to be fun is much harder than I first anticipated. We all seem to have different ideas about the game and what we thought it would be like in our heads which is very difficult to explain. I honestly don’t know how people do it in the industry. I thought that the best way we could possibly explain what we had in mind was to actually create prototypes that each of the other group members could play. The concern with prototyping so early was that we were wasting time all working on our own thing, but I think that it will be the only way to accurately push across our ideas to one another. </p>
						<p> I really don’t know how people do it in the actual game creation industry, I suppose they have a lot more time to have detailed and long design meetings, something that we just did not have the time for. I think we have taken the correct steps but I can’t really be sure until all of our prototypes are finished and we come up with a final design. If we can do this in good timing, I’m sure it will have been worth it. This has really changed my attitude towards what I thought the design process would be like, but again I guess that can be attributed to our lack of time together. Even though we have been meeting regularly, it will never compare to working 9-5 with everyone.</p>
						<p> I’m a little worried by our progress at this point. I’m not sure where we are supposed to be, but I think we should have finalized our design by now. The prototyping is definitely a step in the right direction though so I hope it all falls into place sooner rather than later. </p>
