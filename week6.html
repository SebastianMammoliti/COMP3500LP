						<h1> Mentor Meetings and Continued Prototyping </h1>
						<p> After beginning our prototyping, we started coming up with things we didn’t like about our initial ideas, which is great! I think that the prototyping step that we have taken has led to a bunch of fantastic ideas. My concern about being behind project wise were pretty much dispelled after our meeting with Shayne Flint, who told us that we were pretty much 100% on track and doing the right thing. He even said that the prototyping was a great idea to progress in our design, and that they could also be shown at our first showcase.  </p>
						<p> We met our mentor this week, Zak Bouguettaya, who is part of a team in Canberra who I actually know of, Imagine Team. We met up with him at his office and he gave us some absurdly useful insight into the marketing side of things. It was basically a monetization meeting in the end, and the suggestions and ideas he offered will be invaluable when applied to our own marketing scheme, if we ever have one that is. He really offered insight into the actual industry we are trying to break into, whether it is landing pages, content marketing or easily acquisition of resources. While all of this is a goal, it is something I think we have decided will be secondary until our second game, if it ever comes to that, or if we have a great deal of time before the end of the year. </p>
						<p> We are starting to set up our proper file sharing stuff and repositories which are greatly important when it comes to proper development work. Screenshots of prototypes and such are starting to be shared which I think is really pushing our designs forward in a good way. It has caused us to start discussing more control schemes and overall features which we may not have done if we hadn’t done so many prototypes. Overall the prototyping phase is starting to look better and better, which is something I think all of us are really happy about.</p>
