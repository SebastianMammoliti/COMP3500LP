						<h1> Individual Idea Presentations </h1>
						<p> 
						The game idea that I have decided to present to my team is kind of difficult to explain, but I wanted a sort of rhythm based action game which required you to time your dodges and attacks to progress as fast as you could. I tried to keep it to only two buttons, dodge and attack, so that people could play it with one finger after researching that most successful apps are played with a single finger.

							Benjamin, one of the masters students, stuck with his idea of a turn based RPG. While he presented it well, I don’t think anyone else believed it would handle well on a phone. Artem, the other masters student, had a very innovative idea based on not playing the game at all. You would have to set sliders and stuff the determine behaviour of a character and events would play out automatically based on the sliders. An interesting idea, but I personally thought it would be boring not being able to play and wasn’t really looking to make such a game.

						Unfortunately my game didn’t win the vote in the end, losing to Eamon’s (third year) fantastic concept of a space based game where you used the gravitational pull of planets to slingshot around the game space. I wasn’t really disappointed with the vote not going my way because I genuinely thought that his idea was more suitable for a first time project and generally a better idea for a phone game.

						It was integral to our project that we get the concept and ideas down before we started any coding whatsoever. I found that the way we did things was extremely fair and equal opportunity and I believe that the best idea came out on top and everyone is happy with it. So far everything is going pretty well. We have our idea, now all we need to do is work out the finer design and get started!
